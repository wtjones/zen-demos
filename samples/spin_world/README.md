# SpinWorld Raycast Demo

Pulled from a 2013 archive where I created a simple raycaster based on a [tutorial](https://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting.html). I removed most of the dead code from this 2013 archive. It appears that I was adding shading and other features when the project was abandoned.

## Build and Run

```
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
./build/SpinWorld
```
