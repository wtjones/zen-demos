# RasGL

## Todo

### General

- [ ] Support CTest
- [ ] POSIX - screen resolution shouldn't be hard-coded

### Rendering

- [ ] Add AABB debug view toggle
- [ ] Render origin and grid lines
- [ ] Validate screen points are in screen bounds
- [ ] Fix poly fill gaps
- [ ] Support DOS poly fill
- [ ] Support color ramps
- [ ] Tidy diagnosic rendering to another module
- [ ] Add flat shading toggle
- [ ] Support render layers in DOS
- [ ] Toggle UI layer

### Clipping - Polygon

- [ ] Fix assert on certain far plane clip scenarios
- [ ] Fix assert when a triangle is rotating and clipping on the left side
- [ ] AABB should remain correct when model rotates
- [ ] Carry over pipeline face to clipped polys

### Math

- [ ] Increase whole part of fixed-point scheme from 16 bits
- [ ] Fix model rotation origin

### Models

- [ ] Free model on error during load
- [ ] Assume muliple usemtl lines can refer to same material

### Scene loading

- [ ] Reference larse as a target or package
- [ ] Add scene explanation to README
- [ ] Support parameterized scene loading
- [ ] Configurable background color

### Scene management

### Text

- [ ] Text clipping
  - Might be easier once ortho frustum added.
- [ ] Manage font bitmap via materials
- [ ] Font colors
- [ ] DOS support
- [ ] Height metrics with wrapped text

### Console

- [ ] DOS support
- [ ] Pull down/up animation
- [ ] Prompt echo
- [ ] Size console to visible rows.
- [ ] Suppress scene input when console active.
- [ ] Suppress console input when inactive.
