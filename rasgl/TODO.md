# RasGL

## Todo

### General

- [ ] Support CTest
- [ ] POSIX - screen resolution shouldn't be hard-coded
- [ ] Log buffer overflow - DOS only?
  - Move model to left clip side to trigger.

### Rendering

- [ ] Add AABB debug view toggle
- [ ] Render grid lines
- [ ] Validate screen points are in screen bounds
- [ ] Fix poly fill gaps
- [ ] Support DOS poly fill
- [ ] Support color ramps
- [ ] Tidy diagnosic rendering to another module
- [ ] Add flat shading toggle
- [ ] Support render layers in DOS
- [ ] Toggle UI layer
- [ ] Fix naming or consolidate *projected_to_screen_point()

### Clipping - Polygon

- [ ] AABB should remain correct when model rotates
- [ ] Fix disappearing poly in some near camera clipping cases.
- [ ] Consider a bitmask for planes to simplify cases such as `core_sg_visible_faces()`.

### Math

- [ ] Increase whole part of fixed-point scheme from 16 bits
- [ ] Fix model rotation origin

### Models

- [ ] Free model on error during load
- [ ] Assume muliple usemtl lines can refer to same material

### Scene loading

- [ ] Reference larse as a target or package
- [ ] Add scene explanation to README
- [ ] Support parameterized scene loading
- [ ] Configurable background color

### Scene management

### Map

- [ ] Render map as fixed obj

### Text

- [ ] Text clipping
  - Might be easier once ortho frustum added.
- [ ] Manage font bitmap via materials
- [ ] Font colors
- [ ] DOS support
- [ ] Height metrics with wrapped text

### Console

- [ ] DOS support
- [ ] Pull down/up animation
- [ ] Prompt echo
- [ ] Size console to visible rows.
- [ ] Scene should continue to animate when visible.
- [ ] Flush is triggered when console option. Remap/disable?

### Input

- [ ] Need a more elegant mapping for repeat-enabled keys.

### Grid

### Pipeline

- [ ] Copy materials in new clipping pipeline.

## In Progress

### Rendering

- [ ] Render origin

### Text

### Console

### Models

### Logging

- [ ] Summary: Added summary flush hotkey.
