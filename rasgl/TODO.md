# RasGL

## Todo

### General

- [ ] Support CTest

### Rendering

- [ ] Add AABB debug view toggle
- [ ] Render origin and grid lines
- [ ] Validate screen points are in screen bounds
- [ ] Fix poly fill gaps
- [ ] Support DOS poly fill
- [ ] Material colors in filled polygon mode
- [ ] Shaded polygon mode

### Clipping - Polygon

- [ ] Fix assert on certain far plane clip scenarios
- [ ] Fix assert when a triangle is rotating and clipping on the left side
- [ ] AABB should remain correct when model rotates

### Math

- [ ] Increase whole part of fixed-point scheme from 16 bits
- [ ] Fix model rotation origin

### Models

- [ ] Free model on error during load
- [ ] Support material colors

### Scene loading

- [ ] Reference larse as a target or package
- [ ] Add scene explanation to README
- [ ] Support parameterized scene loading
